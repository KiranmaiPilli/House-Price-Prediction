# House-Price-Prediction
•	The objective entails utilizing the provided features to predict the house prices' values.

•	Utilized the Boston Housing dataset, originally a part of UCI Machine Learning Repository, preprocessing included reading and visualising the data using ‘**pandas**’, ’**matplotlib**’ handling the missing values, scaling numeric features using ‘**scikit-learn**’.

•	Model Selection & Development: Employed **linear regression**, **Decision Tree Regression** and **Random Forest Regression** from **scikit-learn** for predicting house prices. Split the dataset using **train_test_split** and performed cross-validation for robust training.

•	Model Evaluation & Insights: Evaluated models using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. Found Random Forest Regression provided satisfactory predictions.
